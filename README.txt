Requirements / Dependencies : GCC compiler for compiling the c file 
                                                 Terminal 
Input : a verilog file 

Output : line by line explanation of datapath operations along with design overview of circuit and each module in the verilog file shown as output on terminal


Step 1 : Open terminal on your system 

Step 2 : GO (cd) to the directory where the projectfinal.c is located .


Step 3 : TO BUILD THE PROJECT RUN : gcc -o veri parseVerilog.c

Step 4 : To run the program on a verilog file (say sample.v) RUN:  ./veri "sample.v"


The output for the given verilog design file is shown on terminal as output .
